Cat vs Dog Image Classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

This project is a machine learning image classifier that uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to distinguish between images of cats and dogs. The model is trained on the 'cats_vs_dogs' tensorflow dataset of labeled cat and dog images, and uses CNNs to automatically learn features from the images that are useful for distinguishing between the two classes. The model is then able to make predictions on new images by analyzing the learned features and outputting a probability score for each class. This project has practical applications in areas such as animal recognition and pet monitoring, and can also serve as a learning exercise for those interested in computer vision and deep learning.
